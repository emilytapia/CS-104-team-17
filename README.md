Printpal
 
 What is the problem statement of your project? 

Students at NJIT constantly have other responsibilities to carry on throughout their day. 
Students tend to arrive at the Makerspace unknowingly if all printers are currently being used hence, wasting their time. 
With other things to cross off their agenda, the goal of Printpal is to notify students of the status of 3D Printers in the makerspace.
They will be able to view if they are in use, their current progress, or if they are out of order.The open/web app ultimately aims to streamline and improve the experience of using machinery at the makerspace.
This project aims to directly connect students to the printers. Without this solution, a student can go,unknowingly, to the makerspace when all printers are being used.

-Students will save time (be able to plan ahead)
-Students will gain certainty and peace of mind.
-Students are not left in the dark.
-Students will be able view their print progress in real time, and see if there were any errors.
- We wish to provide a live status of all 3D Printers which students can look up.
- Will be able to view if they are in use, their current progress, or if they are out of order.
  
Who are the potential stakeholders of your project? Who has expectations for this project?
 Students, undergrad and graduate, Faculty, staff and program leaders. (out of scope) If this project was sold as a service, clients/customers/business that rely on it.

 What is this project's scope (boundaries, what is in and out)?

-Accuracy for wait time, application gives out estimates to potentially benefit other consumers who are utilizing 3D printers at the same time. 
-Reserving a printer. Because the printers are a public resource, reserving through the web/app gives a disadvantage if timing is not properly planned out.
